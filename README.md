Negative carriers for Beseler 23C enlargers
===========================================


Overview:
---------

Generates laser cutter SVG files are generated by a python script.

Carriers for different films are generated parametrically, making it easy to modify for different films and image sizes.

These carriers are a sandwich type (not hinged).  

There is a separate top and bottom half which fit together on alignment pins.  

These aligment pins also hold the film centerd about the image cutout.



Why Not Buy A Carrier?
----------------------

There are a lot of carriers out there on EBay and elsewhere.  

Some of them can be quite expensive, and used ones are often quite beat up.

I was able to make my own, brand new, for about 30.00 USD, and it was designed exactly how I wanted.



Currently Defined Carriers:
---------------------------
  
  - 35mm film standard 36x24mm image

  - 120 film 6x6cm image

  - 120 film 6x7cm image



Laser Cutting and Assembly:
---------------------------

I used https://www.ponoko.com/ to send me cut parts made from 0.120" black (opaque) acrylic.

Some assembly and acrylic bonding is required.  More details to come.

Acrylic bonding is done with low viscosity acrylic "cement" and a needle dispenser.

If you don't know how to do this, then learn:

Feel free to use, and make new carriers.  Have fun.

Please Note: No, I will not make you one.  Make one yourself!
